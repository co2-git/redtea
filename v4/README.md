redtea
===

Extensive test framework in JavaScript. Different levels of testing offered:

- true/false assertions
- error throwing assertions
- *promisable* assertions
- TDD interface with CLI support

# Indeed

`indeed` lets you return `true` or `false`.

```javascript
import {indeed} from 'redtea';
const foo = 2/2;

if (indeed(foo).is.a(Number) && indeed(foo).is(1)) {
  console.log('âˆš passed');
}
```

# Assuming

`assuming` lets you test the assert way: an assertion error is thrown if assertion fails.

```javascript
import {assuming} from 'redtea';
const foo = 2/2;

try {
  assuming(foo).is.a(Number);
  assuming(foo).is(1);
} catch (error) {}
```

# Describe

`describe` lets you run an assertion inside a Promise.
It uses a TDD syntax and throw on error.

```javascript
try {
  describe(true, it.is.a(Boolean), it.is(true));
} catch (error) {}
```

## Promises

You can easily asserts what is returned by promises.

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve) => resolve(42));

describe.async(myPromise, it.is(42));
```

You can also assert rejections.

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(new Error('...')));

describe.async(myPromise, it.is.an(Error));
```

## Events

You can also assert events. It will listen to events.

```javascript
describe.emitter(emitter.emit('foo', 5),
  it.emits('foo', (msg) => describe(msg, it.is(5))),
  it.does.not.emit('error')
);
```

# Is

`is` the core library of `redtea`. It performs basic synchronous value/type comparison and throws assertion errors on failure. `assuming` is basically a sugar for `is`.

```javascript
import {is} from 'redtea';
const foo = 1;
is(foo, 1);
is(foo, 2); // throws assertion error
is.type(foo, Number);
is.type(foo, String); // throws assertion error
```
